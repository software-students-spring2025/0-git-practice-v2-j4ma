## Article: [From Engines to Algorithms: Gen AI in Automotive Software Development](https://www.mckinsey.com/features/mckinsey-center-for-future-mobility/our-insights/from-engines-to-algorithms-gen-ai-in-automotive-software-development)

### What I found interesting:
This article explores how Gen AI is revolutionizing automotive software development. With the increase of AI-driven development, traditional software development from manual coding, extensive testing, etc and slowly being pivoted towards AI.

One thing I found particularly cool was the fact that **AI-powered automation is reducing development time by up to 50%** and **AI models can generate, test, and refine software components autonomously**. Overall decreasing the amount of resources and time required to produce solid/reliable code.
